# Journal

This is a web app I wrote to keep a daily journal! It's currently for personal use only, but making it publicly accessible is on the roadmap. If you really want to, you could clone the project, set up your own [backend](https://github.com/SimonDMC/journal-worker) and use it on your own instance.

Here's what it looks like:

## Roadmap

-   Search
-   Downloading (backups) from UI
-   Offline mode (basic functionality)
-   Tracking parameter customization
-   Account creation
-   Entry encryption
-   Password reset? (maybe)
